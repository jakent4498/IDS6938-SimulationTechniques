#Homework 1 : The Jello Cube (Continuous Simulation Assignment
## IDS6938-Simulation Techniques - [University of Central Florida](http://www.ist.ucf.edu/grad/)


This is for extra credit or because I was having fun, but did not want to mess up the original assignment.

I edited the cmakelist.txt file to add additional files to include in the code.  I ran cmake to create a separate build directory and from there I made a variety of minor modifications to portions of the code to try different spring constants, different integration methods, and different intervals.  Oh, yeah I have three cubes on the screen at the same time.  They all interact with the environment, but not with each other.
